## Instructions on how to reproduce the Project
Users can download the credit database from http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Credit.csv.
Users can reproduce the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by finding summary statistics and plotting data plots. They can also find the relationship between the dependent and independent variables through frequency and anova.
Users can use the same pre-modeling data process method.
By setting the seeds and using cross validation method, users can generate training and testing sets and use those sets to run regression models.
Users can perform ridge regression, lasso regression, Principal components regression, partial least squares regressions.
Users can find the guidelines through slides.



## phony targets
Your Makefile should have the following Phony targets:

all: will be associated to phony targets eda, regressions, and report
data: will download the file Credit.csv to the folder data/
tests: will run the unit tests of your functions
eda: will perform the exploratory data analysis
ols: OLS regression
ridge: Rdige Regression
lasso: Lasso Regression
pcr: Principal Components Regression
plsr: Partial Least Squares Regression
regressions: all five types of regressions
report: will generate report.pdf (or report.html)
slides: will generate slides.html
session: will generate session-info.txt
clean: will delete the generated report (pdf and/or html)
The rule for the target regressions should be written like this:

regressions:
    make ols
    make ridge
    make lasso
    make pcr
    make plsr
