From the analysis, we can see that the MSE are similar to each other. The OLS has the smallest MSE, which is the best fit model for the credit data set. The ridge regression has the largest MSE among the five regression, which is the least best fit model. From the tables above, most of the coefficients are similar except for PLSR.

When comparing the cross validation on both ridge and lasso, lasso cross validation is less consistent than ridge cross validation
